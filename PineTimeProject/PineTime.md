## Smartwatch app for the opensource PineTime.

[< back](https://codethepast.github.io/)
A few weeks ago I bought my first [PineTime](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime), with the dev kit.
In order to practice with coding I decided to program an app for this open source smartwatch.

The idea is to create an app for the watch where I can check out elements of a list (shopping list, inventory, and the like).
In order to do that I planned to:
1. Make an android app (ToDoLister) for my phone: the list will be created on a mobile large screen and stored in a local csv file.
2. Send the file to the watch through bluetooth. 
3. Create an app (ListChecker) for the watch: where you can scroll the list and check (ie. select/highlight/...) the single items of the list. No need to re-save the file or update it.

Let's see how it works.

## Android ToDoLister app
To make the android app I used the easy platform of [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) by MIT.
