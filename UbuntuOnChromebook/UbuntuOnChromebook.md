## Ubuntu installation on a 9 years old Chromebook.

[< back](https://codethepast.github.io/)

In **2013**, when I was working in the US, I bought a **Chromebook Acer C720P-6666** (with touchscreen) that worked well for long time. It was not my main machine, but was perfect for some activities and handy for the small size.

Unfortunately, Some months ago Google decided to stop supporting my model. After some time I started experiencing software issues and glitches. Therefore, I decided to challenge myseft in installing **another OS on this laptop**, an Ubuntu distro of Linux, giving a try to this 9 years old laptop to continue journey together. Together with this OS upgrade I also wanted to provide more disk memory. 

Here, the process and the results!

First of all you can find here the top- and bottomview of the laptop.
