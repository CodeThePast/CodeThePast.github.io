In 2013, when I was in the US, I bought a Chromebook Acer C720P-6666 that worked well for long time. It was not my main machine, but was perfect for some tasks and handy for the small size. 
Unfortunately, Some months ago Google decided to stop supporting my model. After little time I started experiencing some software issues. Therefore, I decided to challenge myseft in installing another OS on this laptop, an Ubuntu distro of Linux, giving a try to this 9 years old laptop to continue journey together.
Here, the process and the results!
