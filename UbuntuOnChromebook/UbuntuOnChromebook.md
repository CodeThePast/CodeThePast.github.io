## Ubuntu on a 9 years old Chromebook

[< back](https://codethepast.github.io/)

In **2013**, when I was working in the US, I bought a **Chromebook Acer C720P-6666** (with touchscreen) that worked well for long time. It was not my main machine, but was perfect for some activities and handy for the small size.

Unfortunately, Some months ago Google decided to stop supporting my model. After some time I started experiencing software issues and glitches. Therefore, I decided to challenge myseft in installing **another OS on this laptop**, an Ubuntu distro of Linux, giving a try to this 9 years old laptop to continue journey together. Together with this OS upgrade I also wanted to provide more disk memory. 

Hoping this post could help somebody else with similar need here I describe the process and the results!

## Hardware upgrade

Differently from other models, the Acer C720P has the touchscreen and only 2GB of RAM, that unfortunately cannot be expanded. As for the disk, the laptop originally has a 32GB SSD, that is enough for a web based chromebook, but might be tight for a complete Ubuntu system. 

Please note that for this model the SSD is a SATA M.2 2242 form factor type.

There are several online resources that show how to change the original SSD with a new one:
- Here a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZa5kWBfbWM) by *unlokia* showing how to properly open this laptop model and how to find the different hardware components.
- Here a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrL2Qy2PGI), mounting a 64GB SSD. 
- Here a [blogpost](https://www.umpcportal.com/2014/01/how-to-upgrade-the-acer-c720-chromebook-with-an-m-2-sata-from-mydigitalsdd/) mounting a 128GB SSD.

First of all you can find here the top- and bottomview of the laptop.
